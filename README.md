### This Python project performs a comprehensive linear regression analysis along with diagnostic checks to validate model assumptions.

#### Features
- Loads and extracts variables from CSV data
- Visualizes linearity between features and target
- Tests for homoscedasticity (constant variance)
- Fits an OLS linear regression model
- Visualizes residuals to check normality
- Performs autocorrelation tests on residuals
- Calculates Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to detect multicollinearity
